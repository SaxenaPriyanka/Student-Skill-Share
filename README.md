## **HOW TO INSTALL & RUN THE CODE**

## **WHY I BUILT IT** 
Being a pandemic era student myself, I realized the challenges in learning virtually, while being socially isolated from peers. By building this web application, I wanted to help students to easily connect with each other, collaborate, and support each other's learning and improve the overall learning experience.
